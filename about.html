    My name is Andrew Barr. I am a college student at the University of Rhode Island, and I am enrolled in a <br>
        Computer Science class. This is my very first time taking a class that involves coding, and I hope that <br>
        I can develop a better knowledge of the inner workings of websites and programs that impact our daily <br>
        lives.
Add a background image instead of a color. Use the myBackground.jpg image that you created in Step 2(b).
        
At least two pictures of you. One of which should be yourname.jpg from Step 2(a). These should be incorporated into the web page nicely (e.g. as a CSS floating image).
At least two pictures of things from your life (i.e. hobbies, interests, etc.). These should be incorporated into the web page nicely (e.g. as a CSS floating image). Remember, all web page images must be uploaded to your File Manager.
